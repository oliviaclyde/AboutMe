    <h3 id="highlight" onmouseover="onMouseOver()" onmouseout ="onMouseOut()">Sr. Treasury & Financial Analyst</h3>
    <p>I have been working in the finance sector for over 10 years. Recently I spent the last 8 years working
      as the Senior Treasury and Financial Analyst for IM Flash Technologies, a multi-billion dollar semiconductor manufacturing
      joint-venture between Micron and Intel. I was soley responsible for forecasting and managing all cash in the business.
      I peformed excellent under pressure in closely managing timing of massive capital equipment cash flows while accounting for regular operating cash flows.
      Additionally, I helped migrate our systems to a new banking partner while remaining compliant with internal banking policies and corporate banking resolutions.
      <br><br>My Three Top Achievements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Successfully managed over $1B in cash in a 12 month period to fund captial equipment purchases</li>
          <li>Partnered closely with CFO to forecast upcoming cash need</li>
          <li>Ensured successful and smooth transition to new banking partner</li>
        </ul>

       <h3 id="highlight1" onmouseover="onMouseOver1()" onmouseout ="onMouseOut1()">Rim2Rim</h3>
         <p>In May 2017 I hiked Rim2Rim. This is a grueling, 23.9 mile trek...and we did it in one day. Starting point was the North Rim on the North Kaibab Trail, 5 a.m. We hiked
       down 14.3 miles and 6,000 feet to Phathom Ranch for lunch. If you are lucky enough to be draw in the lottery they run every year, you could have a chance to stay overnight
       there. After lunch we crossed the Colorado River. Wow! It was incredible. Then the real work started. Taking Bright Angel Trail we climbed 4,500 feet over 9.6 miles
       to get back out, arriving at the South Rim at 5 p.m. <br><br>Three Things I Learned:</p>
<!-- Ideas: add a section where pictures of myself on the trip could horizontal scroll through -->
        <ul>
          <li>Embrace the hard</li>
          <li>Carry salt tablets</li>
          <li>Down is optional, Up is required</li>
        </ul>
  </div>
<!--Ideas: add a "Learn More" section that connects you with information about the hike
If you pulled some data and stored it in an database (AWS, for instance) you could have a
feature where you could check the temperature of the trail by month" -->

       <img src="halfmarathon.jpg" id="halfimg" alt="Large picture of racers running down canyon in a half marathon">
       <h3 id="highlight2" onmouseover="onMouseOver2()" onmouseout ="onMouseOut2()">13.1</h3>
         <p>I have trained for and completed two half marathons (2014 and 2017). Both these halfs were in June,
           which meant I started training in January. This meant three-mile runs, three-times a week before work in the dark in freezing temperatures.
           I'm not afraid of hard things. Just before my long training run for the first half, I suffered an IT band injury. I was able to still race
           but spent the next year barely able to run a half mile while fighting the flare-up. I learned how to be smart and avoid injury during the training for my second
           half. <br><br>Key Takeaways: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Layers are key</li>
          <li>Do the long run</li>
          <li>Be cognizant of injury potential</li>
        </ul>
